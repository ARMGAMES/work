  Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1950.txt
  (zlib format), rfc1951.txt (deflate format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format).

ZEXTERN gzFile ZEXPORT gz2open  OF((POutputStream* outStream, PInputStream* inStream, const char* mode));
/*
     Opens a gzip (.gz) file for reading or writing. The mode parameter
   is as in fopen ("rb" or "wb") but can also include a compression level
   ("wb9") or a strategy: 'f' for filtered data as in "wb6f", 'h' for
   Huffman only compression as in "wb1h". (See the description
   of deflateInit2 for more information about the strategy parameter.)

     gzopen can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format; in this
   case gzread will directly read from the file without decompression.

     gzopen returns NULL if the file could not be opened or if there was
   insufficient memory to allocate the (de)compression state; errno
   can be checked to distinguish the two cases (if errno is zero, the
   zlib error is Z_MEM_ERROR).  */

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT gz2setparams OF((gzFile file, int level, int strategy));
/*
     Dynamically update the compression level or strategy. See the description
   of deflateInit2 for the meaning of these parameters.
     gzsetparams returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the file was not
   opened for writing.
*/

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT    gz2read  OF((gzFile file, voidp buf, unsigned len));
/*
     Reads the given number of uncompressed bytes from the compressed file.
   If the input file was not in gzip format, gzread copies the given number
   of bytes into the buffer.
     gzread returns the number of uncompressed bytes actually read (0 for
   end of file, -1 for error). */

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT    gz2write OF((gzFile file, 
				   const voidp buf, unsigned len));
/*
     Writes the given number of uncompressed bytes into the compressed file.
   gzwrite returns the number of uncompressed bytes actually written
   (0 in case of error).
*/

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORTVA   gz2printf OF((gzFile file, const char *format, ...));
/*
     Converts, formats, and writes the args to the compressed file under
   control of the format string, as in fprintf. gzprintf returns the number of
   uncompressed bytes actually written (0 in case of error).
*/

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT gz2puts OF((gzFile file, const char *s));
/*
      Writes the given null-terminated string to the compressed file, excluding
   the terminating null character.
      gzputs returns the number of characters written, or -1 in case of error.
*/

ZEXTERN char * ZEXPORT gz2gets OF((gzFile file, char *buf, int len));
/*
      Reads bytes from the compressed file until len-1 characters are read, or
   a newline character is read and transferred to buf, or an end-of-file
   condition is encountered.  The string is then terminated with a null
   character.
      gzgets returns buf, or Z_NULL in case of error.
*/

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT    gz2putc OF((gzFile file, int c));
/*
      Writes c, converted to an unsigned char, into the compressed file.
   gzputc returns the value that was written, or -1 in case of error.
*/

/*
      Reads one byte from the compressed file. gzgetc returns this byte
   or -1 in case of end of file or error.
*/

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT    gz2flush OF((gzFile file, int flush));
/*
     Flushes all pending output into the compressed file. The parameter
   flush is as in the deflate() function. The return value is the zlib
   error number (see function gzerror below). gzflush returns Z_OK if
   the flush parameter is Z_FINISH and all output could be flushed.
     gzflush should be called only when strictly necessary because it can
   degrade compression.
*/

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT gz2eof OF((gzFile file));
/*
     Returns 1 when EOF has previously been detected reading the given
   input stream, otherwise zero.
*/

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT    gz2close OF((gzFile file));
/*
     Flushes all pending output if necessary, closes the compressed file
   and deallocates all the (de)compression state. The return value is the zlib
   error number (see function gzerror below).
*/

ZEXTERN const char * ZEXPORT gz2error OF((gzFile file, int *errnum));
/*
     Returns the error message for the last error which occurred on the
   given compressed file. errnum is set to zlib error number. If an
   error occurred in the file system and not in the compression library,
   errnum is set to Z_ERRNO and the application may consult errno
   to get the exact error code.
